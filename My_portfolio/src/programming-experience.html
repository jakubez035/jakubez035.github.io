                <h2 class="programming-subtitle">What is Programming?</h2>
                <p class="programming-paragraph">Programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer which tasks to perform in order to solve problems. You can think of programming as a collaboration between humans and computers, in which humans create instructions for a computer to follow (code) in a language computers can understand.</p>
                <p class="programming-paragraph">Programming enables so many things in our lives, such as:</p>
                <ul class="programming-list">
                    <li>Browsing websites and interacting with elements like buttons and forms.</li>
                    <li>Apps that help you order food, book rides, or track your fitness.</li>
                    <li>Software that helps businesses operate more efficiently, such as file storage or video conferencing tools.</li>
                    <li>Even space exploration is made possible through programming!</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="programming-section">
                <h2 class="programming-subtitle">Is Programming Hard?</h2>
                <p class="programming-paragraph">Much like learning any other language, programming takes effort and consistency. Anecdotally, it gets easier to learn other coding languages once you've mastered your first. The good news is that there are courses for every learning level, from small children to experienced programmers expanding into new languages.</p>

            <section class="programming-section">
                <h2 class="programming-subtitle">My Experience</h2>
                <p class="programming-paragraph">When I was younger, I enjoyed playing games and became interested in how they worked. How are surroundings, characters, and levels designed? How do keyboard and mouse inputs translate into movements? These questions sparked my curiosity, and I began researching game programming platforms and learning about programming languages, tutorials, and guides.</p>
                <p class="programming-paragraph">I created a game using Unity called "Blocker." It was a simple game where a cube moves forward, and you had to avoid obstacles by pressing A or D. Although it followed a tutorial, it taught me a lot. Over time, I switched to Python, drawn by its potential for automating tasks. Today, I use Python to automate various processes, such as signing up for tickets, web scraping, and checking emails.</p>
