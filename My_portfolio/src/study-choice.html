                <p class="study-choice-paragraph">I think that choosing the right study is important, because it will affect a big part of your life. You have to be very careful, because you don’t want to be stuck doing something you hate. That’s why I’m giving some of my advice on what I did to be sure I chose the right program and what keeps me going.</p>

                <h2 class="study-choice-subtitle">Study Choice Activities</h2>
                <p class="study-choice-paragraph">To be honest I was really sure about my program choice as programming has been my hobby for a few years. That didn’t stop me from doing proper research and solidifying my mind. To help with this, I called some of my friends who study in the Netherlands to get to know what it’s like living in a foreign country, what mental load they have to deal with, etc.</p>
                <p class="study-choice-paragraph">For the specific program, I talked with students who had already gone through at least part of it. We discussed their mistakes and how they could have prepared better, so I’d be more ready to tackle the study year. I also talked about the program with HZ representatives at a university conference, and I did a career choice test at my school.</p>

                <h2 class="study-choice-subtitle">Why I’m Interested in Programming</h2>
                <p class="study-choice-paragraph">I’m interested in programming because I enjoy problem-solving and a little challenge. Thinking outside the box is what I love, even more so when I can't figure out a solution and it keeps me up all night. I like the feeling of dopamine when I finally figure it out and learn something new that I can implement when I face future challenges or life obstacles.</p>

                <h2 class="study-choice-subtitle">After Completing My Studies</h2>
                <p class="study-choice-paragraph">After finishing my studies, I hope to have learned better ways to identify the problems I'm facing and how to dissect them into smaller fragments. This way, I can find different ways of solving them through various perspectives.</p>
                <p class="study-choice-paragraph">Programming, to me, is like learning a new language — it's just about repetition. However, problem-solving is the core component of programming, and that’s something I can only improve through practice.</p>
