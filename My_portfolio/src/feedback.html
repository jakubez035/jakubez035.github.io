                <p class="feedback-paragraph">Feedback is essential, because it provides insight into performance, behavior, or understanding, allowing individuals to improve or maintain their quality of work. It can come in various forms—verbal, written, or through data—and plays a vital role in growth and development. By highlighting both strengths and weaknesses, feedback enables people to adjust their actions and behaviors, ultimately boosting their performance.</p>
                <p class="feedback-paragraph">It also promotes open communication, helping clarify expectations and align efforts toward shared goals. When delivered constructively, feedback not only drives progress, but can also boost motivation and morale, making it a crucial element in personal and professional development.</p>

                <h2 class="feedback-subtitle">My Feedback</h2>
                <p class="feedback-paragraph">I received feedback on my project from various sources. Some have been positive, while others had a few notes on what I could improve. What did I do? I wrote down both the positive and negative comments and evaluated if they were valid. I tried to gain a different perspective so I could understand what they saw.</p>
                <p class="feedback-paragraph">Ultimately, I took most of the comments and implemented those changes into my project. Of course, I didn’t blindly follow everything people said, but I also didn’t disregard it completely. This helped me move forward, and now my project looks better than ever!</p>
