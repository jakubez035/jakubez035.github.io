                    and I love pushing my limits. In programming language I would describe myself as a code that can always be more structured, look better, function better etc. I try to be better everyday wheter physically, mentally or emotionally. I don't like shortcuts or easy paths, I like discomfort, because that's what shapes us into better people. There's a quote I really love to use: "How you do one thing is how you do everything.", which basically means that no matter what you do you should always do it on 100%, because if you half-ass it, what's stopping you from half-assing everything.

                    Now for more information about myself. I'm from Slovakia, I attended Spanish grammar school for 8 years. I love mathematics and informatics, mainly for their logical nature. During the last 4 years of high school I recieved a complimentary diploma for great academic results every year and I graduated math in top 3% of students in Slovakia in the year 2024. In the year 2021 I participated in DofE and earned a brozne award and in the year 2022 I attended a Spanish language course in Salamanca, Spain for which I recieved a certificate. I've been actively going to the gym for more than 2,5 years and ran a few Spartan races ranging from 5k to 22km. As my other hobbies I enjoy learning the behavior of the stock market (mainly commodities) and playing video games with my friends from time to time.
