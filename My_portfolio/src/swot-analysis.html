                <p class="swot-analysis-paragraph">A SWOT analysis helps you identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats for a specific project or your overall business plan. It’s used for strategic planning and to stay ahead of market trends. Below, we describe each part of the SWOT framework and show you how to conduct your own.</p>

                <h2 class="swot-analysis-subtitle">Why is it Important?</h2>
                <p class="swot-analysis-paragraph">A SWOT analysis can help you improve processes and plan for growth. While similar to a competitive analysis, it differs because it evaluates both internal and external factors. Analyzing key areas around these opportunities and threats will equip you with the insights needed to set your team up for success.</p>
                <p class="swot-analysis-paragraph">A SWOT analysis isn’t only useful for organizations. With a personal SWOT analysis, you can examine areas of your life that could benefit from improvement, from your leadership style to your communication skills. These are the benefits of using a SWOT analysis in any scenario.</p>

                <h2 class="swot-analysis-subtitle">My SWOT Analysis</h2>
                <ul class="swot-analysis-list">
                    <li><strong>Strengths</strong>: Focus and determination in learning new skills. I believe that when you fail, you are presented with an opportunity to learn, analyze your mistakes, and improve. The only way to truly fail is to give up.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: Waking up for classes and taking advice that could prevent a mistake or failure. I often like to do things my way, which sometimes causes unnecessary setbacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Opportunities</strong>: Opportunities to develop new skills and gain new perspectives. I want to be challenged.</li>
                    <li><strong>Threats</strong>: Sometimes I take on too much to prove that things aren't as hard as people claim. My goal during my stay here is to avoid overwhelming myself and instead ease into it, taking things one step at a time.</li>

                <p class="swot-analysis-paragraph">Once you've completed a SWOT analysis, use the results as a decision-making aid. It can help prioritize actions, develop strategic plans that play to your strengths, improve weaknesses, seize opportunities, and counteract threats. It’s a useful tool for setting objectives and creating a roadmap for achieving them.</p>
